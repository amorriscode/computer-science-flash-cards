## What rule can you use to calculate the runtime of a recursive function?

`branches^depth`

Branches are the number of recursive calls made to the function. Depth is the value passed to the first call.

Let's look at fibonacci as an example:

```javascript
const fibonaive = n => {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return 0;
    } else if (n === 1) {
        return 1;
    };
 
    return fibonaive(n - 1) + fibonaive(n - 2);
};
```

This is `O(2^n)` (we branch twice per call, and we use `n` in the call).
