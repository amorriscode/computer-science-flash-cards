## What is the time complexity for adding and removing an element to the middle of an array?

- Adding: `O(n)`
    - We have to shuffle all elements after our insertion point up then add our new element
- Removing: `O(n)`
    - We have to remove the desired element then shuffle all elements after our deletion point down
