# What's the difference between `typeof` or `instanceof`?

%

## `typeof`

- Returns a string with the type of whatever you pass
- Seven basic types: `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `object`, `function`, `undefined`, `Symbol`

## `instanceof`

- Works on the prototype level
- Tests if the right operand appears anywhere in the prototype chain of the left operand
- Doesn't work on primitive types
