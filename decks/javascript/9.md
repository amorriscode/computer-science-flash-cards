%

- Immeditately Invoked Function Expression
- A function that is invoked as soon as it is defined

Benefits:

- Isolating parts of code to hide from the outside world
- Specify input interface to your code; reference globals within your IIFE scope
- Helps prevent global scope pollution with ES5 module pattern
