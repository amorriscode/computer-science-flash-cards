# Markdown Computer Science Flash Cards

This repository contains flash cards for my studies computer science/programming studies. Uses [ankdown](https://github.com/benwr/ankdown) for building Anki decks.

Happy studies! ðŸ¤“

## Creating Decks

1. Create a folder under `decks/`
2. Add `.md` files with your cards (refer to [ankdown](https://github.com/benwr/ankdown) for card formatting)

## Building Your Decks

1. Make the build script executable

    ```bash
    chmod +x ./build.sh
    ```

2. Execute the build script

    ```bash
    ./build.sh
    ```

3. Import your `.apkg` files into Anki

## My Decks

## Contributing
